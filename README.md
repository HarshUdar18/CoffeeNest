# CoffeeNest

This GitHub project is for a website design project. The website is a personal blog for a coffee enthusiast. The design is inspired by the image, which shows a woman enjoying a cup of coffee in a cozy setting. The website will have a clean and modern look, with a focus on the images and text. The main features of the website will be:

<br>A gallery of coffee photos
<br>
A blog where the user can share their thoughts on coffee
<br>
A contact form so that users can get in touch with the author
<br>
The website will be built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
<br>
The code will be well-commented and organized, making it easy to understand and maintain. 
<br>
The project will also include a README file with instructions on how to set up and run the website.
<br>

This project is a great opportunity to learn about web development and design. It is also a chance to create something that you are passionate about. If you are interested in contributing to this project, please feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request.
